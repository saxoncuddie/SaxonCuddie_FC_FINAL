# Fish Creek Clinic 

This repository is the final project for my Web Application Devlopment and Security class. This project was designed to highlight the following:

Front-end: Using react app to create a fully functional and interactive webpage that would simulate how a real world site would look and feel.
Back-end: Using node.js to run a local server that is able to record and handle incoming data.
Integration: Enhacing the site with features such as jQuery, API Integration, and other full-stack dev practices so that the site is as responsive and user friendly as possible.

Full list of tools used:


Fron-tend: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,jQuery,React App


Back-end: Node.js


Development tools: Visual Studio, Git, Github



--IMPORTANT NOTICE--
This project was designed so that node.js will run on local port 5000, and react app will run on local port 5173. If either of these ports are being used prior to running, the sites will not work properly.

node.js is also required to run this properly. Download can be found here -> https://nodejs.org/en <-



--Install Instructions--

1. Download the zipfile and unzip it in suitable location.
2. After installation open command prompt at the root of both node_backend and react_frontend files.
3. For the command prompt at node_backend, run the command " node app.js "  
The node should now be running on http://localhost:5000
4. For the command prompt at react_frontend run the command " npm install " 
This is so that correct dependancies are installed.
5. Now run the command " npm dev run "
The react site should now be running on http://localhost:5173.
6. Open up http://localhost:5173 in a browser of your choosing.
7. The site should now be fully functional and ready for testing.
If you wish to look at incoming form submission, fill out the form under the "contact" page, and go back to the command prompt for node_backend to see incoming data.
